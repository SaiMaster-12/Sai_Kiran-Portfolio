# Sai_Kiran-Portfolio 
macOS-Inspired Interactive Portfolio Desktop

> **Not just a portfolio. An operating-system-like experience — inside your browser.**

This project recreates the **look, feel, and behavior of macOS** using modern frontend technologies.  
Windows float, apps open, content scrolls naturally — just like a real desktop.

## What Makes This Project Special?

This is **not** a static website.
This is **not** a normal React app.  

It’s a **desktop simulation** built from scratch.

### Core Highlights

  - Proper z-index stacking
  - macOS-style traffic light controls

2. **Finder-Like Experience**
  - Sidebar navigation
  - Folder-style interactions
  - Clean, native layout

3. **Photos / Gallery App**
  - Displays images from `public/images`
  - Click → opens Image Viewer window
  - Minimal, clean macOS grid layout

4. **Safari-Style Browser App**
  - Custom Safari UI header
  - Blog listing inside a browser window

5. **Resume PDF Viewer**
  - Multi-page PDF rendering
  - Smooth scrolling
  - Fixed window header (like Preview on macOS)

## Why This Project Stands Out

Most portfolios show:
- Pages  
- Sections  
- Cards  

This one shows:
- **Architecture**
- **State management**
- **Complex UI behavior**
- **Real debugging skills**

It demonstrates how to:
- Build a **window manager**
- Handle **scroll, height, and overflow correctly**
- Design **desktop-grade UI systems** in React
